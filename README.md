This is our final project for CMSC 12200: Computer Science with Applications 2, winter 2018. We scraped data from evaluations.uchicago.edu and built a website where users can quickly and easily find an overview for a given course or professor. They can view aggregated data across multiple evaluations to quickly compare courses, professors, and departments. The evaluations data is not publicly available due to privacy concerns, but our code is included.
